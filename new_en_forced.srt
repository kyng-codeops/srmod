1
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,125
There will be no bargain.

2
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:13,056
I will not give up
my favorite decoration.

3
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:18,461
I like Captain Solo where he is.

4
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:18,343
Ah! Do that again!

5
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,753
I have come for the
bounty on this Wookiee.

6
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:31,050
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

7
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:59,109
I want fifty thousand. No less.

8
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:51,650
This bounty hunter is my kind of
scum, fearless and inventive.

9
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,869
It's too late for that, Solo.

10
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,798
You may have been a good smuggler...

11
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,526
...but now you're Bantha fodder.

12
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,526
Take him away.

13
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:30,985
Bring her to me.

14
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,324
I'm sure.

15
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:20,200
I told you not to admit him.

16
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:24,868
He must be allowed to speak.

17
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,828
You weak-minded fool!

18
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:35,086
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

19
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,753
Your mind powers will
not work on me, boy.

20
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,078
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

21
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,902
I shall enjoy watching you die.

22
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,248
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

23
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,434
They will all suffer for this outrage.

24
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:06,180
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

25
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,836
Move him into position.

26
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,984
Put him in.
