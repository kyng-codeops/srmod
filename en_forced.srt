1
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,125
There will be no bargain.

2
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:13,056
I will not give up
my favorite decoration.

3
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:18,461
I like Captain Solo where he is.

4
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:47,843
Ah! Do that again!

5
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,753
I have come for the
bounty on this Wookiee.

6
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:57,050
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

7
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:25,109
I want fifty thousand. No less.

8
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:17,650
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum... 
fearless and inventive.

9
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:31,869
It's too late for that, Solo.

10
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,798
You may have been a good smuggler...

11
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,226
But now you're Bantha fodder.

12
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,526
Take him away.

13
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,985
Bring her to me.

14
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,324
I'm sure.

15
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:48,700
I told you not to admit him.

16
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:53,368
He must be allowed to speak.

17
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,328
You weak-minded fool!

18
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:03,586
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

19
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,253
Your mind powers will
not work on me, boy.

20
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,578
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

21
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,402
I shall enjoy watching you die.

22
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,748
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

23
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,934
They will all suffer for this outrage.

24
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:49,180
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

25
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,936
Move him into position.

26
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,084
Put him in.
